# QuizBowlProject


## Overview
This project is a Quiz application where users can take quizzes across different categories. The questions are stored in a SQLite database, and a graphical user interface (GUI) is provided for user interaction.

## File Structure
- `addDataToDB.py`: This file contains the code to create the SQLite database and populate it with questions for various categories.
- `main.py`: This is the main application file that creates the GUI for the quiz and handles user interactions.
- `questions.db`: The SQLite database file that stores questions categorized into different subjects.
- `readDB.py`: This file reads from the SQLite database and displays the questions and answers for each category.
- `Readme.md`: Documentation for the project.
